What is the software development lifecycle(SDLC)?
The software development lifecycle is a framework that defines developing the steps involved in the development of software ay each phase, covering the detailed plan for building, deploying, and maintaining the software.

There are seven stages of the software development lifecycle
1.Requirements and analysis
This is the first and fundamental stage of SDLC. Business analysts gather requirements from their customers, target market, and industry experts to create a Business Specification (BS) document.

2.Project Planning
Based on the Business Specification document, senior development team members bring together the input of stakeholders and experts to plan out a software development project.

3.Design
This stage focuses on designing the product. It involves product architects and developers who will ideate and present a design of the product. They may present more than one design approach, and these ideas are documented in a Design Document Specification (DDS).

4.Coding and Implementation
In this stage, production commences and the product is built. The programming code is built per the DDS (Stage 3), so the product can be created with the utmost efficiency. Developers use various tools and programming languages to build the code. These are selected based on the demands of the software being developed.

Some of the programming tools may involve: 

Compilers 
Interpreters
Debuggers
The programming languages may entail: 

C
C++
Python
Java 
PHP

5.Testing
Stage 5 is where the development team conducts software testing to find errors and deficiencies. Here the product is checked to see if right results are produced.

6.Deployment
Once the software application has undergone testing and QA, it is delivered to the customer. This stage usually involves deployment engineers who make software available to customers. They may install the software at a company and/or help individual customers run the application on their computers. 

7.Maintenance
Because a software productâ€™s usage varies from customer to customer (each person has different needs), there may be unique issues that come up and need to be addressed. These customer issues are solved in this maintenance stage.
